# Trudging Through the Ashes

Run Arthas through the level, collecting 20 Acolytes by moving him close enough to the "Acolyte in Hiding" red-shaded villagers to trigger their transformation.

## Overview

Acolytes are marked as numbers on the following map, in the recommended order:

The "Find the Graveyard" optional quest (marked as `💀` on the map) is required; hug the fence when running past the graveyard to trigger it, then explicitly command the spawned minions to attack the gate (marked as `⚔` by Acolyte 11 on the map) to open up the final part of the city.

Make sure to kill the human Captain of the Town Guard (marked as `⚔` between Acolytes 4 and 5 on the map); this will give Arthas enough experience to reach Level 2 after Acolyte 7; when he does, immediately learn Unholy Aura  passive movement speed boost.

## Notes

- There are a few extra Acolytes, marked as `+` on the map
- Some potions can be collected on this mission to aid in future missions:
    - Two crates along the main route (marked as `⚗️` on the map) each drop a potion when broken
    - One enemy in each of the two fights marked as `⚔` on the map drops a potion when killed
