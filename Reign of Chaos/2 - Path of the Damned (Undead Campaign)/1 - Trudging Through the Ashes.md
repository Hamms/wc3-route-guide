# Trudging Through the Ashes

## Overview

Run Arthas through the level, collecting 20 Acolytes by moving him close enough to the "Acolyte in Hiding" red-shaded villagers to trigger their transformation.

The "Find the Graveyard" optional quest (marked as a skull on the map) is required; hug the fence when running past the graveyard to trigger it, then explicitly command the spawned minions to attack the gate (marked as a pair of crossed swords by Acolyte 11 on the map) to open up the final part of the city.

Make sure to kill the human Captain of the Town Guard (marked as a pair of crossed swords between Acolytes 4 and 5 on the map); this will give Arthas enough experience to reach Level 2 after Acolyte 7; when he does, immediately learn Unholy Aura for that all-important 10% passive movement speed boost.
