## Video Overview

[This SGDQ submission video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7nSDl3vnfs) for the RoC Undead Campaign is a fantastic resource; the primary goal of the video is to demonstrate to GDQ staff what it might look like to feature this route in an event, but that means the video includes a lot of explanation not just of the route, but of individual strats and techniques and even some explanatory context. _Great_ information for a first-time runner, and the primary resource on which this guide was originally based. Credit to CovertMuffin for making such a useful reference without even intending to.

## blasterpoard's overview

- **UD1** is easy; look at blasterpoard's' campaign WR
- **UD2** is even harder than it looks in the WR video; consider learning it last, and also consider learning strategies used by runs in 2nd or 3rd place
- **UD3&4** are not that hard, but require following the route precisely; look at blasterpoard's' campaign WR
- **UD5** you can choose between [the easy way](https://www.speedrun.com/wc3/run/zqr4vl9y) or hard way (failed in blasterpoard's run); start with easy one
- **UD6** either play it casually (tech to T3, train ~12 gargs, attack), or follow blasterpoard's' campaign WR run if you're confident
- **UD7** is easy; look at blasterpoard's' campaign WR
- **UD8** is hard, but you should learn it anyway. Look at everything you can find, other than blasterpoard's old 13min IL run

## misc notes

- any patch is ok for running UD; even 1.32 (current) loses very little time compared to the other campaigns
