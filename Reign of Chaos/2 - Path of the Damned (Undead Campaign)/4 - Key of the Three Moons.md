# Key of the Three Moons

Use the starting forces plus the two free Zeppelins and some mercenary Goblin Sappers to target down the three Altars of Kings, and use a Necropolis plus a Scroll of Town Portal to run directly to the elfgate.

## Overview

Take your forces east to the Goblin Merchant and load them into the Zeppelins. Specifically:

**Zeppelin 1**
- Arthas
- Necromancers
- Ghouls
- Crypt Fiends (filler)

**Zeppelin 2**
- Acolytes
- Meat Wagons
- Crypt Fiends (filler)

Take Zeppelin 1 west and obtain the Scroll of Mana. Simultaneously, take Zeppelin 2 north through the Way Gate then east across the water, where you build a Necropolis. Zeppelin 1 should fly to the northwest corner of the map while Zeppelin 2 drops a Meat Wagon just on the other side of the trees to the west of the northeastern Way Gate; begin carving out a hole in the trees. With Zeppelin 1, destroy the Altar of Kings in the northwest. With Zeppelin 2, put your Meat Wagons in the hole in the trees, and with them destroy the Altar of Kings in the north.

Take Arthas to the Mercenary Camp in the southeast and buy two Goblin Sappers. Use them to destroy the final Altar of Kings and complete the key. Double-click the Scroll of Town portal to teleport Arthas to the Necropolis and run into the circle.

## Notes

**Targeting Order** Necromancers have a high targeting order, so when attacking the Altar of Kings you want to send out Arthas and the Ghouls first. Once they've killed at least one elf, unload the Necromancers and immediately Raise Dead. The Necromancers will pull focus as soon as they unload, but the Skeleton Warriers are even higher on the targeting order; once summoned they will in turn pull focus from the Necromancers.

**Scroll of Town Portal** can be purchased in the previous mission.
