# Under the Burning Sky

Beat the mission without waiting for the timer by destroying all enemy structures.

## Overview

Defend against the attack from the east, haunt the Gold Mine to the southeast. Build a ton more Ziggurats to the north and upgrade them for defense. Macro up; build lots of Meat Wagons and Crypt Fiends. Get Goblin Land Mines for speed, and Scroll of Healing for safety. At about 25 minutes remaining on the Summoning clock, the first wave of Hellhounds will spawn. With them in your army, launch your attack against the eastern base. Begin by clearing out the units with Goblin Land Mines; use summoned Skeleton Warriors to keep aggro off of Arthas. Bring in the Crypt Fiends and Hellhounds to deal with the remaining units and reinforcements, then the Meat Wagons to clear out the buildings.

At about 20 minutes remaining, a second attack will arrive from the west. Fight it off, then macro back up and finish clearing out the western base. Once ready, clear out the western base; same battle plan as the previous base. After the western base is clear, move your army north to the edge of the map, then east to the northern base. This time, bring in the Crypt Fiends with Arthas in the first wave to deal with the Gryphon Riders; then, clear out the base as normal. Infernals will arrive at about 10 minutes remaining to help finish off the base.

## Notes

Kill the ghost to free up pop

Get Web for gryphons

Unsummon some buildings at start (which?)

Get attack upgrades for Meat Wagon before first base

Focus down enemy unit production buildings; enemies have infinite resources, and will be constructing reinforcements the entire time you're in their base.

Meat Wagons can take out the wall towers of the western base from out of range by targeting manually.

Each base has a theme: the western base is footmen, knights, and riflemen; the eastern is steamtanks, gyrocopters, and mortars. The northern base is gryphons.
