# The Fall of Silvermoon

Build up about a control group full of Crypt Fiends, add in the free Gargoyles from the Silvermoon Runners optional quest, and take them all directly to the Sunwell.

## Overview

Make sure you immediately begin by building a Fiend and summoning a second Crypt for building more. You'll also want to unsummon your Altar of Darkness and begin summoning a Ziggurat. Fend off Sylvanas' attack from the north, then research Creature Attack and start building Crypt Fiends. While we amass our attack force, move your army west. Take out the troll camp across the bridge to get some gold and a mana potion, and to kill time while waiting for the Silvermoon Runners quest to start. Kill the runner, take the Gargoyles, and head south. Take out the elves in the area just across the bridge, then take on the four Granite Golems which comprise the Sunwell guardians. Pick off the first two by pulling them one at a time out of the range of the towers, then rush in and kill the last two right by the Sunwell itself.

## Notes

You again want to use Skeleton Warriors to help with survival in Sylvanas' initial attack; see "Targeting Order" in the last mission.

The guardian Golems will priority target Gargoyles, so you can use them in the final battle to tank damage for the Crypt Fiends.

## Questions

From https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Fall_of_Silvermoon_(WC3_Undead)#Notes:

> If the necromancer unit is killed during Sylvanas surprise attack in the beginning of the mission, then the dialogue warning about Sylvanas attempting to warn Silvermoon will not occur and the optional quests will not show up on the mission menu. Though players will still be able to create Gargoyles but the "new unit" acquired mention will not trigger.

I wonder if this could be useful?
