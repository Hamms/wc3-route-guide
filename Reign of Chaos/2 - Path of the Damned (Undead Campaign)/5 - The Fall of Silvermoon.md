# The Fall of Silvermoon

Build up about a control group full of Crypt Fiends, add in the free Gargoyles from the Silvermoon Runners optional quest, and take them all directly to the Sunwell.

## Overview

Make sure you immediately begin summoning a second Crypt for building your Fiends. You'll also want to unsummon your Altar of Darkness and begin summoning a Ziggurat. Fend off Sylvanas' attack from the north; target her, then head west. Take out the troll camp across the bridge to get a mana potion and kill time while waiting for the Silvermoon Runners quest to start. Kill the runner, take the Gargoyles, and head south. Mass your troops in a staging area north of the Sunwell, by the pool. Pull one (or two? Not clear what's the ideal goal here) of the four Granite Golems comprising the Sunwell guardians, then once they're dead proceed into the Sunwell and kill the rest.

## Questions

From https://wow.gamepedia.com/The_Fall_of_Silvermoon_(WC3_Undead)#Notes:

> If the necromancer unit is killed during Sylvanas surprise attack in the beginning of the mission, then the dialogue warning about Sylvanas attempting to warn Silvermoon will not occur and the optional quests will not show up on the mission menu. Though players will still be able to create Gargoyles but the "new unit" acquired mention will not trigger.

I wonder if this could be useful?
