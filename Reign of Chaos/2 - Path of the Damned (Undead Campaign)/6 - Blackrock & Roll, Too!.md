# Blackrock & Roll, Too!

Safe strategy: build mass Gargoyles, target down Red Dragons, then safely (but slowly) clear out the base from the air.

## Overview

### Mass Gargoyles (safest, slowest)

Defend against the first attack, then take your army and start clearing out camps for gold and items; sell items for more gold, and start building Gargoyles. Balance your population around upkeep limits by killing off unneeded units. Once you have enough, ball up your Gargoyles and Frostwyrm and aggro one of the Red Dragons into the mountain range southwest of the enemy base. Clear out the other two one at a time, then destroy the enemy base, starting with the red-dragon-producing structure.

## Notes

When the Blademaster splits, the "real" copy will be the one _not_ taking extra damage.

If you park Arthas safe somewhere on the other side of the mountain range, you can fly Gargoyles back over to him for healing.

Save the Blades of Attack to sell in a later mission.

Kill off Peons to stop them from rebuilding the base.
