# The Seige of Dalaran

Run Arthas and Kel'Thuzad directly to and then kill Antonidas.

## Overview

Destroy the gate then the first Archmage with your army, then have Arthas and Kel'Thuzad enter the city once the shield is down. Cast Frost Armor on both of them, then order Kel'Thuzad to move directly to the end of the mission and manually follow with Arthas. Arthas should stay far enough behind Kel'Thuzad to make sure that he's the one taking damage. Once past the second "city", Death Coil Kel'Thuzad and reapply Frost Armor to both heros before heading into the final fight. Target down Antonidas; use Death Coil and healing potions.

## Preparation

To survive, Arthas will likely need to be carrying a Potion of Greater Healing. If your game is not already in this state, you can simply load [this save file](https://github.com/Hamms/wc3-route-guide/raw/master/Reign%20of%20Chaos/2%20-%20Path%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Undead%20Campaign%29/7a%20-%20end%20of%20chapter%20six.w3z) from near the end of Chapter Six.

## Notes

From blasterpoard:

> in UD7, you don't need any items; bringing an abomination (as shown in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLKz4KPp-wg) is consistent and the trick to killling the archmage is coming with arthas into melee range first and only then using a coil - priest HPS cancels out with arthas DPS, archmage is killed by 2 coils, nova and lich autoattacks; if you coil at from afar, there is time between your 2 coils when arthas is not attacking and archmage's HP goes up because of a priest heal, making you barely not kill him (and require a potion to be able to cast 3rd coil)
