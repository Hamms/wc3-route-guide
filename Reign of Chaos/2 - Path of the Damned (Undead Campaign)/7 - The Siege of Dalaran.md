# The Seige of Dalaran

Run Arthas and Kel'Thuzad directly to and then kill Antonidas.

## Overview

Destroy the gate then the first Archmage with your army, then have Arthas and Kel'Thuzad enter the city once the shield is down. Cast Frost Armor on both of them, then order Kel'Thuzad to move directly to the end of the mission and manually follow with Arthas. Arthas should stay far enough behind Kel'Thuzad to make sure that he's the one taking damage. Once past the second "city", Death Coil Kel'Thuzad and reapply Frost Armor to both heros before heading into the final fight. Target down Antonidas; use Death Coil and healing potions.

## Preparation

To survive, Arthas will likely need to be carrying a Potion of Greater Healing.
