# Digging up the Dead

## Overview

Take your forces east, engage the humans. Manually target a Meat Wagon to aggro the paladin without crossing into the event trigger zone, and kill him. Run Arthas through the town and into the circle.

Haunt the Gold Mine and summon a Necropolis, then take your army north. Aggro the militia and take them out without engaging the paladin. Then, aggro the paladin with Arthas alone, and draw him into the fenced-off area. Block him in with Ghouls and wait for Divine Shield to dissipate, then kill him.

Once the Necropolis has finished, build a pair of Crypts and start massing Ghouls. Clear out trees at the end of the first paladin's base with your Meat Wagons until you can see the Barracks in the western base. Meanwhile, take Arthas and the Ghouls south through the city, to just outside of the western base. Attack the Barracks with your Meat Wagons to aggro the Footmen into your waiting army. Start summoning 3 Ziggurats while clearing out the Footmen, then engage and kill the final paladin.

Gather the Ghouls you've managed to build so far and engage Uther; efficient use of Death Coil is necessary for a one-cycle kill, otherwise his Divine Shield will activate a second time.

## Notes

Manually-targeted Meat Wagons can quickly end engagements once a line has been established.

It takes some time, but you can gather some health and mana potions in the previous mission.
